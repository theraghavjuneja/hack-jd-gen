       "\"\\nYou are organizing a hackathon whose details are given below:\\n    \\nOverview\\nDrawing from the resounding success of the Great AppSec Hackathon 2021, which boasted an impressive turnout of over 6000 registrations, 5000+ participants, and 700+ finalists nationwide, the Cybersecurity Centre of Excellence (CCoE) , DSCI is thrilled to unveil the forthcoming 2024 edition of the Great Hackathon. Anticipation for this year's event is palpable.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe Great AppSec Hackathon - 2024, organized by CCoE, is an endeavor targeting students from diverse academic backgrounds (B.Tech/M.Tech/M.Sc/B.Sc/MCA/BCA). The 2024 edition of the Hackathon is going international and is now open to students from all around the globe!\\n\\nThe initiative's primary objectives are manifold: \\n\\nTo raise awareness about cybersecurity.\\nFoster skill development.\\nProvide employment and internship opportunities for students.\\nAssist organizations in identifying and attracting top talent.\\nEnhance the overall cybersecurity landscape within the ecosystem.\\nAs we prepare for this eagerly awaited event, our mission is to cultivate innovation, collaboration, and excellence in the cybersecurity realm, thereby contributing to the collective advancement of technology and security practices across India.\\n\\n \\n\\nOverview of Application Security :\\nSecurity is not limited to a few experts. Be it, application developers or infrastructure specialists, knowledge in security and privacy will help them create acceptable applications. With the advent of mobile, there are over 2million apps each on Android and iOS. But an interesting fact is 55% do not make it to the platform as they would have missed the security and privacy consideration while developing the application.\\n\\n \\n\\nWeb Applications are a growing focal point for cybercriminals.\\n\\nThe most recent statistics from the Verizon Data Breach Report focusing on the retail sector indicate that web applications are a major target for cybercriminals. Specifically, 70% of breaches in the retail sector originated from web applications.\\nThe whole reason we want to avoid web-based threats is to mitigate the risk of a data breach. The average cost of a data breach is 4.24 million dollars\\nThe risk to business is significant when an application vulnerability is exploited leading to an outage, data breach, or brand degradation.\\n\\n \\n\\nObjectives:\\n\\nCreate awareness on threats and vulnerabilities related to application security.\\nGamified approach towards learning, Skill building, and providing internship opportunities for students\\nEncourage students in Application security and help organizations to attract the right talent.\\nBoost the cybersecurity quotient in the ecosystem.\\nEligibility: \\nFor INDIAN Participants\\n\\nStudents of all disciplines (B.Tech/ M.Tech/ MCA/ BCA/ B.Sc)\\nFor INTERNATIONAL Participants \\n\\nStudents of all disciplines\\nNote: Please register and create a login using your own personal credentials, since the same creds/logins will be used consistently across all rounds, including MCQ and CTF\\n\\n\\nGuidelines\\nPlease register and create a login using your own personal credentials, since the same creds/logins will be used consistently across all rounds, including MCQ and CTF.\\nThis is an online event.\\nAll Dates and Times are IST.\\nIn addition to published game rules, host site policies and rules apply throughout the competition and must be respected by all members of the competition.\\nViolations of the rules can be deemed unprofessional conduct if determined to be intentional or malicious by the CCoE operation team. \\nParticipants should work independently; sharing answers or collaborating with another participant to secure multiple spots is deemed as unprofessional conduct. \\nAll the traffic is monitored. Any attack on the CTF infrastructure is a violation of game rules and the participants performing the attacks will be eliminated/blocked from the CTF event. \\nDecisions of the CCoE operations team are final and binding. \\nNo extra time will be provided to Competitors who stop work during competition time for nature breaks or for those who break for food and/or drink. The access to the challenges will be revoked once the competition is complete. \\nThe Credentials for the CTF panel will be provided to the participants prior to the event. \\n\\nPrizes\\nExciting Prize Pool\\nINR 10 Lacs and Beyond\\nExciting Prize Pool of INR 10 Lacs and beyond.\\n\\n\\n\\nAccess to Internship and Job Opportunities\\n\\n\\nParticipation Certificates\\nParticipation Certificates from CCoE, DSCI (Data Security Council of India) - A NASSCOM Initiative.\\n\\n\\nSponsors\\nPlatinum Sponsor\\nSecurin\\nTo fuel every organization in the world with seamless security as a fundamental part of their business.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCollaborators\\nEcosystem Partner\\nTelangana State Cyber Security Bureau (TSCSB)\\nThe Telangana State Cyber Security Bureau (TSCSB) was established in response to the exponential rise in cybercrimes and cybersecurity challenges. ...\\n\\n\\n\\nInternational Academic Partners\\nSponsor\\nCardiff University (UK)\\nCardiff University is a public research university in Cardiff, Wales.
